    <p><strong>June 21, 2025</strong></p>
    <br /><p><i>Happy Birthday, Pau!</i></p>
    <br /><p>You are twenty-one on the twenty-first. Angel number energy! Happy birthday, teh.</p>
    <br /><p>You are finally twenty-one. On the twenty-first. And of course, I had to pick Fearless as your background song. You are a Swiftie, I am a Swiftie, and this one just feels like you. Not just because you love Taylor, but because you have always been that kind of girl. Strong, soft, quiet, but brave even when things get hard.</p>
    <br /><p>We have been together for so long. Since elementary pa. Same school every step of the way. Different course now, but still the same campus. And despite all the changes, we stayed close in our own way. I think that is something not everyone gets to have, so I am really grateful for it.</p>
    <br /><p>Junior high was chill lang. We were just going with the flow. Happy lang. But senior high came in like a storm. Doon natin unang naranasan ang tunay na iyakan over subjects. Physics pa talaga HAHAHA. Grabe ang culture shock natin sa HRA. I still remember how confused we were during the first few weeks. We laughed, we panicked, we almost gave up, but we survived. That part of our life was a mess, but at least we were a mess together.</p>
    <br /><p>Now we are in college. Third year is already on the horizon. Time moved so fast. It still feels unreal sometimes.</p>
    <br /><p>And girl, I still remember that one time I asked if pwede ba magpalagay ng ulam sa ref nyo in the middle of the night. Literal late na yun ha, then nakalimutan ko kunin because sobrang naging busy ako. Literal na ilang hakbang lang tayo apart, pero hindi pa rin ako makapunta. Sorry teh, always the busy friend talaga.</p>
    <br /><p>Thank you for staying. For always being there. For understanding even when I disappear. Kahit bihira na tayo mag-usap or magkasama, we have always been the same. Still laughing at the same things. Still tagging each other in random reels on IG/FB. Still that quiet type of friendship that stays steady. No pressure. No drama.</p>
    <br /><p>Now let us talk about you for a second, woi. I have been seeing your glow lately ha, sus ah. Aminin mo na, you look happy. You look softer now. More at peace. Maybe it is the love life, no? Arinyan na siya. I am not even going to ask ulit if you have a label or not, baka spoiler char. But whatever that is, I just hope it brings you more joy than confusion. I hope he makes you feel loved and safe and seen. And most of all, I hope no one hurts you. You have such a soft heart. You never say everything out loud, but I know when something is not okay. That is why even if you do not tell me, I hope you are healing from whatever it is you are carrying. Quietly, safely, and at your own pace. You deserve peace even when you do not ask for it.</p>
    <br /><p>Also, sorry kung nachismis ko kay Zed. Gusto ko lang talaga makichismis ng kaunti. Love you huhu.</p>
    <br /><p>You have always been that type. You never overshare. You keep things close to your chest. And that is okay. But I still hope that even when you do not say anything, you still feel supported. That you know someone is always on your side, even in silence.</p>
    <br /><p>I know we are on different paths now. Different courses. Different circles. Different daily lives. But nothing ever beats what we have. Ours has always been simple but strong. I do not think I will ever find another friendship like this. Solid pa rin with the Pansang, wherever life takes us.</p>
    <br /><p>Happy twenty-first, my Swiftie twin. You have always been fearless in your own quiet way. Keep being you.</p>
    <br /><p>With all the chika,<br><i>Yurie</i></p>
